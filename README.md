A Minimal E-commerce App 🚀

A minimal features e-commerce app I made to upskill my learning. This app allows users to authenticate, view products, and add to cart. I used REST API to show product details and Firebase Authentication for secure login and signup functionality.

What Can Users Do? 🤔

Authenticate 🔒: Users can login and signup using Firebase Authentication
View Products 🛍️: Users can view products with details fetched from REST API
Add to Cart 🛒: Users can add products to cart and view cart details

How I Built It 💻

Flutter: Cross-platform mobile app development framework
Firebase Authentication: Secure authentication solution
REST API: Used to fetch product details and descriptions

Features 🌟

Login Screen 🔑: Users can login using their email and password
Signup Screen 📝: New users can create an account using email and password
Home Screen 🏠: Users can view products, add to cart, and navigate to product details
Product Details 📦: Users can view detailed product information, fetched from REST API
Cart Screen 🛒: Users can view added products, update quantity
Profile Screen 👤: Users can view their profile information and details
